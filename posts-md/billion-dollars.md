title: Talk to people like you have a billion dollars

These days I've been thinking about how we interact with people. Honestly it's something that I overthink a lot, from texting, to sparking up a conversation with a stranger, to just having conversations with my friends. 

How do we know the right thing to say in these instances, especially when we're trying to get to know someone.

Especially when it comes to selling yourself to people for example if you're Interested in going on a date with someone or trying to get money from a VC etc.

I think the key is that you need to treat yourself like you have a billion dollars.

So imagine you had a billion dollars and the people you talk to, you're giving them one dollar the first time you're talking to them.

And then they're interested and as you keep talking to them, you're giving them more money.

Most people get this backwards. They over-explain, they chase, they try to be everything. And in this analogy, they are broke. And that doesn't work. People can feel this energy of scarcity.

When you have a billion dollars, you don't chase. You're not worried about the dollar you gave out. If they didn't appreciate it, that's fine, you've got more. You just move on.

There's also something important about the direction of this that I think gets overlooked. Most people think of social situations as something that YOU extract from. You're trying to get someone to like you, to say yes, to invest in you. But this flips it completely. YOU'RE the one giving. You're bringing something to the table and letting them decide if they want to sit down. This shift in perspective changes EVERYTHING about how you show up.

As the conversation picks up and keeps going, you give more, not because you have to but because they've shown they value what you're sharing. They're curious, asking questions back. 

And if they don't respond? You still have a billion dollars.

title: Getting rid of things you don't need
date: November 19, 2025

I used to have a lot of unnecessary things.

What I realized over the years is that a lot of it would sit untouched for years under my bed, in my closet, stuffed in a box, etc...

To be honest I still have a lot of things that I don't need. I need to get rid of many of them.

You can think of your room as Macbook or iPhone storage. It is limited, and for some reason half of it eventually gets taken up by "System Data" and "MacOS" or "iPhone". And then you just gotta factory reset it all. Apps tell you when they were last opened and how much time you spent on them in your screentime. For a lot of the apps, it would have been months or years since they were last launched. 

So if you see yourself in this situation, here are the benefits of freeing your storage on your device, and how it translates to your room.

1. Your device will run faster -> you'll be able to know where everything in your room is quickly, spend less time looking for things or forgetting something you misplaced. 
2. You'll have more space to do something that requires a lot of it, like making YouTube videos -> you'll be able to have friends hang out in your room, record a podcast, do an art project, yoga... 
3. You'll be less distracted. Less apps = less distractions, and more lean: having just those that you really truly need -> you'll have less random worries or thoughts, easier to lock in on the immediate present task, especially if you put your phone somewhere you cannot easily access.
4. It will give your device room to breathe. If you ever need to download something, you don't need to worry about optimizing your storage by deleting caches. Do you really want to be in your storage settings 1+ times/week? -> Your room will have more breathing space. It'll be easier to get clothes from your closet. Easier to find your beloved pen. You won't need to worry about finding space for something new.

There are a lot of benefits that come to having a nice, minimal, clean room. 

But the best thing about it is that you'll be able to turn it into a space that brings you joy. 

That's what your room should ultimately feel like. A space that brings you joy. 

So how do you let go of your things? 

What I'd say is this. Start by targeting the most immediate things that come to mind. 

What things don't you like? What do you despise? You might have some things that you don't care about or maybe even ANNOY you. Get rid of them immediately. 

Don't spend time trying to find one of your friends who could use it. If there's someone in mind then sure but don't search for that person. Donate it somewhere like Goodwill and that person will find it themselves.

Next, go through your things one by one. I'd say start off with your clothes. 

For each of your clothes, feel it. Look at it. Does it bring you joy? 

If not, it can bring joy to someone else. 

What you wear should be YOU. You shouldn't hold on to things that you don't wear. If you don't wear it someone else can. 

Don't worry about selling these (or anything else for that matter) unless it's something that would be worth your time selling. 

If it takes a week to sell a shirt for $10 but 1 hr of your time is worth $15, do you think it's worth it? 

Not even the time you're actively doing work like listing the product etc. 

Not to mention the mental toll: 'Oh, did I check Depop today to see if anyone bought my stuff??'

And then when you go on Depop or Marketplace or any of these other apps, you start seeing posts and get distracted. 

So unless it's something truly worth the time I'd say don't try selling stuff. Maybe delegate it to someone like a younger sibling you want to teach financial principles or someone who's interested. Otherwise just donate them to someone who can use it. 

Then go through the things on your tabletops and storage areas. How often do you use it? Again, does it bring you joy? 

If it's something you haven't used in the last year, I think it's safe to say that might not spark that joy and it's time to move on.

If it's something you're saving just in case you ever need it, think about it. Wouldn't you have used it by now?

If you ever need it, you can just buy another one. 

Lastly, go to the sentimental things. This is the hardest part, because these things we are attached to emotionally.

Look at these, and if it's something you're ready to move on from, give it its moment and let go.

The truth is, the important thing about these is the feelings and memories that these things gave us. That's the important part, and that will always be with us.

I wanted to share some thoughts on the recent layoffs at tech companies.

I feel for the people who lost their jobs. I think in America, our work is strongly tied to our identity.

At the same time, I think it can be selfish to target companies for laying off employees. 

The game of companies in the American economy is to optimize for profit. To make profit, these companies need to bring value to the world. 

In order to bring value to the world, they need employees that can bring value to the company.

If people aren't bringing in value to the company, three things may happen. 

1) their position will be modified to something that is more valuable to the company, or 

2) they will remain in their position, but be negatively impacting the company.

3) If the company is unable to modify the employee's position to be more valuable to the company, the employee will be laid off. 

This is the natural course of the American economy.

75 yrs ago, jobs looked different than they do today. In another 75 yrs, they will look different again. 

I think it's important to remember that America is innovative and competitive. 

Things are constantly changing and we need to adapt and be proactive in our careers.

We need to find a path in our careers that we truly love.

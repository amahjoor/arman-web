title: How to use your Chipotle points
date: November 5, 2025
---
During the week, I eat Chipotle quite a lot. 

While I am at school, it is the most nutritional, low-cost ($9.50 with tax), and closeby spot (<5 min from anywhere I'd normally be on campus.)

Thus, the choice is an easy one to make, to spend my lunch money on Chipotle. On average I have it 3 times a week.

At Chipotle, you earn 10 points for every $1 spent. So if you buy a $10 entree, that is 100 points right there. 

I've racked up like 6,000 points, which means that I've spent $600 on Chipotle, which is roughly 60 entrees of purchases.

So I thought to myself, how can I maximize my point spending? Since I spend a lot of money on Chipotle, I guess I can reward myself back with the best return on my points possible.

I did an analysis on all items you can redeem points on in the app, with pricing based on the Chipotle location at my school.

The best thing you can get to maximize your points' return value is double protein with carne asada as the choice of the extra (almost 10% return). 

Not gonna lie, personally I am not the biggest fan of chipotle's carne, at least in burritos/bowls. It might hit with quesadillas though, I may give it a shot with that. 

This analysis is based on the Chipotle location at GMU Fairfax campus, which has lower prices than a lot of other chipotles I've been to. So if you're at a Chipotle in SF, Manhattan, or another higher-price location, your return would be valued higher than it would here. If you travel often, I'd say save your points for the place you travel to that has higher pricing Chipotle to get the best return on points.

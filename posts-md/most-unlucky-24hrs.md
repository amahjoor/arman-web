title: The most unlucky days
date: January 6, 2026

Today was a crazy one.

My friend Jake and I had planned to attend CES conference this week (1/5 - 1/9). We were going to take a Frontier flight with a transfer and arrive there around 8:30 PM on 1/5. 

Turns out the 2nd leg of our connection to Vegas was canceled at 3 am the day of (1/5.)

We had the option to book another flight through Frontier (for free) but all the available options seemed bad. Either getting us to the conference later or having an extraordinarily long time. One had a 7 hr overnight layover in Ontario's airport, where it turns out the airport workers kick you out overnight. We also had an option to take a direct flight on 1/6 but arrived at 2 pm and thought it wouldn't give us time to see the conference. 

We ended up searching across Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn to find anyone who was carpooling from the Bay Area to the conference. We found one guy but he didn't respond. So we decided to rent a car ourselves. We drove 11 hours from SF to Vegas (some stops here and there), arriving to our Airbnb at 2 AM.

When we got there, all the beds were taken by other guests. Jake and I slept on an air mattress with 2 thin blankets (2-3 millimeter thickness) each that couldn't even cover us fully and we couldn't fall asleep. It was fucking cold, there was cold air from the AC hitting us. My feet were sticking out of the blanket and I had a seperate towel to cover them. 

Jake and I both got about 1 hour of sleep in total. We woke up at 7 am and went to the gym. We needed to reset. 

After we finished at the gym, we drove back to the Airbnb. 

When we returned, we emptied the car from most of our stuff. The car automatically locked itself as we walked away. 

We dropped our stuff in the house, but then, for some reason, we couldn't find our keys.

We searched through what we thought was all our stuff and couldn't find it. Jake even emptied his bag which was like impossible for the keys to be in there. 

I thought the keys fell in a crack in the car, so we called the rental service to summon someone to manually unlock it. We had to pay a $68 fee.

The name of the guy who unlocked it was Mike. He was a chill guy. He opened it, but the keys weren't there.

We searched the house, car, and outside for 2 hours. No luck.

We called the gym to ask if they had seen the keys. Maybe I dropped them in the parking lot as I started the car. No luck.

At this point we didn't know what to do. I was looking for ways to find solutions. Jake was just numb and out of it completely and silently staring at the paint on the walls. 

I was just about to call a Lyft to the gym which was 30 mins away to search the parking lot and it would've cost another $50 round trip. I decided though, to take one last look around.

I looked at the table. A clear bag of roasted Trader Joe's almonds I had brought in was on it. 

I don't know if I was intending on just grabbing some almonds to munch on or to search the table itself. But I looked more closely at the almonds bag. 

Something black was sticking out on it.

I looked closer. My heart dropped with relief and slight pain. I realized that was the key.

I grabbed it and we returned the car 30 minutes before it was due, and took a Lyft to CES.

Got to enjoy it. We were sleep deprived, defeated, but we made it. 

Moments like this make you realize your limits. You can get stretched so thin, feeling like the world is against you. But then, you realize how amazing it is to just have the things you have. Because when you don't, you go through hell like that.

It also made me realize that the value of money is completely relative. I spent $68 for a guy to unlock a car, and later that night, I spent $75 on all-you-can-eat Wagyu. The cost was nearly identical, but the experience couldn't have been more different. The desperation of that unlock fee vs the pure joy of that dinner made me realize money isn't directly correlated to happiness. It's just a tool that facilitates experiences, for better or worse.

I also thought I lost my entire car in New York once ($10k value). I left the keys in the car for the valet at this parking garage but forgot to stick around for the ticket (it was my first time and thought people just walk away, lol). When I went to retrieve it, my phone died, and I went to the wrong garage at first. The attendant helped me look through EVERY key box. We couldn't find it. I felt like my core was going to implode.

But then I realized the place was a different one. I think I looked through my Google Maps history or something and saw that it was a different address.

Sometimes you have those moments where you have no one to turn to. It's just you and yourself. When you handle them, you level up. You realize how fragile tangible things are, and how much you should cherish things while you have them. Never leave loose ends.

From now on, I am going to fucking ensure that I have my keys whenever I exit my car. I think that's what these things teach you. Simple lessons like that.

I just want a keyless L5 autonomous vehicle tbh. Or maybe I should just buy AirTags to hook onto things like these.

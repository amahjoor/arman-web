Philosopical ideas are like startup ideas but very big picture.

Startups affect society in ways both narrow or wide. Philosophy, is like startup but in the sense of affecting society in a very wide way.

We can hypothesize all we want, and back our ideas up with logic. We can learn a lot about them and write whole books on them. 

But in a lot of cases we can't know for sure if these ideas are the right ones until we've tested them.

It's only until we've seen their affect on society and talked to the people that we can say for sure.

Philosophical ideas are a lot like startups. Founders might have assumptions but they need to talk to customers, iterate, and create feedback loops.

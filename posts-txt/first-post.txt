title: Hey, this is my first blog post
date: November 3, 2025

I just redid my website, going back to the roots of vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

I'm going to use this space to share ideas, learnings, and my general thoughts on different things. The world, projects I'm working on, whatever I'm figuring out, and anything that feels worth sharing.

I hope reading these can bring some joy to your life. Or at least something useful or entertaining for a moment.

More to come.

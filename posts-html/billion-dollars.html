                <p>These days I&#39;ve been thinking about how we interact with people. Honestly it&#39;s something that I overthink a lot, from texting, to sparking up a conversation with a stranger, to just having conversations with my friends. </p>
                <p>How do we know the right thing to say in these instances, especially when we&#39;re trying to get to know someone.</p>
                <p>Especially when it comes to selling yourself to people for example if you&#39;re Interested in going on a date with someone or trying to get money from a VC etc.</p>
                <p>I think the key is that you need to treat yourself like you have a billion dollars.</p>
                <p>So imagine you had a billion dollars and the people you talk to, you&#39;re giving them one dollar the first time you&#39;re talking to them.</p>
                <p>And then they&#39;re interested and as you keep talking to them, you&#39;re giving them more money.</p>
                <p>Most people get this backwards. They over-explain, they chase, they try to be everything. And in this analogy, they are broke. And that doesn&#39;t work. People can feel this energy of scarcity.</p>
                <p>When you have a billion dollars, you don&#39;t chase. You&#39;re not worried about the dollar you gave out. If they didn&#39;t appreciate it, that&#39;s fine, you&#39;ve got more. You just move on.</p>
                <p>There&#39;s also something important about the direction of this that I think gets overlooked. Most people think of social situations as something that YOU extract from. You&#39;re trying to get someone to like you, to say yes, to invest in you. But this flips it completely. YOU&#39;RE the one giving. You&#39;re bringing something to the table and letting them decide if they want to sit down. This shift in perspective changes EVERYTHING about how you show up.</p>
                <p>As the conversation picks up and keeps going, you give more, not because you have to but because they&#39;ve shown they value what you&#39;re sharing. They&#39;re curious, asking questions back. </p>
                <p>And if they don&#39;t respond? You still have a billion dollars.</p>

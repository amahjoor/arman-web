                <p>I used to have a lot of unnecessary things.</p>
                <p>What I realized over the years is that a lot of it would sit untouched for years under my bed, in my closet, stuffed in a box, etc...</p>
                <p>To be honest I still have a lot of things that I don&#39;t need. I need to get rid of many of them.</p>
                <p>You can think of your room as Macbook or iPhone storage. It is limited, and for some reason half of it eventually gets taken up by &quot;System Data&quot; and &quot;MacOS&quot; or &quot;iPhone&quot;. And then you just gotta factory reset it all. Apps tell you when they were last opened and how much time you spent on them in your screentime. For a lot of the apps, it would have been months or years since they were last launched. </p>
                <p>So if you see yourself in this situation, here are the benefits of freeing your storage on your device, and how it translates to your room.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Your device will run faster -&gt; you&#39;ll be able to know where everything in your room is quickly, spend less time looking for things or forgetting something you misplaced. </li>
                <li>You&#39;ll have more space to do something that requires a lot of it, like making YouTube videos -&gt; you&#39;ll be able to have friends hang out in your room, record a podcast, do an art project, yoga... </li>
                <li>You&#39;ll be less distracted. Less apps = less distractions, and more lean: having just those that you really truly need -&gt; you&#39;ll have less random worries or thoughts, easier to lock in on the immediate present task, especially if you put your phone somewhere you cannot easily access.</li>
                <li>It will give your device room to breathe. If you ever need to download something, you don&#39;t need to worry about optimizing your storage by deleting caches. Do you really want to be in your storage settings 1+ times/week? -&gt; Your room will have more breathing space. It&#39;ll be easier to get clothes from your closet. Easier to find your beloved pen. You won&#39;t need to worry about finding space for something new.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There are a lot of benefits that come to having a nice, minimal, clean room. </p>
                <p>But the best thing about it is that you&#39;ll be able to turn it into a space that brings you joy. </p>
                <p>That&#39;s what your room should ultimately feel like. A space that brings you joy. </p>
                <p>So how do you let go of your things? </p>
                <p>What I&#39;d say is this. Start by targeting the most immediate things that come to mind. </p>
                <p>What things don&#39;t you like? What do you despise? You might have some things that you don&#39;t care about or maybe even ANNOY you. Get rid of them immediately. </p>
                <p>Don&#39;t spend time trying to find one of your friends who could use it. If there&#39;s someone in mind then sure but don&#39;t search for that person. Donate it somewhere like Goodwill and that person will find it themselves.</p>
                <p>Next, go through your things one by one. I&#39;d say start off with your clothes. </p>
                <p>For each of your clothes, feel it. Look at it. Does it bring you joy? </p>
                <p>If not, it can bring joy to someone else. </p>
                <p>What you wear should be YOU. You shouldn&#39;t hold on to things that you don&#39;t wear. If you don&#39;t wear it someone else can. </p>
                <p>Don&#39;t worry about selling these (or anything else for that matter) unless it&#39;s something that would be worth your time selling. </p>
                <p>If it takes a week to sell a shirt for $10 but 1 hr of your time is worth $15, do you think it&#39;s worth it? </p>
                <p>Not even the time you&#39;re actively doing work like listing the product etc. </p>
                <p>Not to mention the mental toll: &#39;Oh, did I check Depop today to see if anyone bought my stuff??&#39;</p>
                <p>And then when you go on Depop or Marketplace or any of these other apps, you start seeing posts and get distracted. </p>
                <p>So unless it&#39;s something truly worth the time I&#39;d say don&#39;t try selling stuff. Maybe delegate it to someone like a younger sibling you want to teach financial principles or someone who&#39;s interested. Otherwise just donate them to someone who can use it. </p>
                <p>Then go through the things on your tabletops and storage areas. How often do you use it? Again, does it bring you joy? </p>
                <p>If it&#39;s something you haven&#39;t used in the last year, I think it&#39;s safe to say that might not spark that joy and it&#39;s time to move on.</p>
                <p>If it&#39;s something you&#39;re saving just in case you ever need it, think about it. Wouldn&#39;t you have used it by now?</p>
                <p>If you ever need it, you can just buy another one. </p>
                <p>Lastly, go to the sentimental things. This is the hardest part, because these things we are attached to emotionally.</p>
                <p>Look at these, and if it&#39;s something you&#39;re ready to move on from, give it its moment and let go.</p>
                <p>The truth is, the important thing about these is the feelings and memories that these things gave us. That&#39;s the important part, and that will always be with us.</p>

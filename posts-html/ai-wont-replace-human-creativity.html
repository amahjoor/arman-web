                <p>I recently had a chance to listen to Lex Friedman&#39;s interview with Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar Games: the studio which created the GTA series, Red Dead Redemption series, among other games. </p>
                <p>Dan has helped craft some of the most beautiful stories ever told in video games.</p>
                <p>After watching that interview, I&#39;ve been thinking about AI and creativity.</p>
                <p>My prediction is that AI, in its current architecture, will not ever be able to replace human creativity. </p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, I believe that AI produces very generic outputs, even with extensive prompting. One could even argue that it&#39;s really the creativity of the human that&#39;s being input, and the AI is just drawing on similar answers it has seen before. Even then, it tends to standardize or average out its responses, rather than come up with something truly novel.</p>
                <p>So what I think is that generative AI will not be able to &quot;replace us&quot;. People are nervous about this, but it will not be able to.</p>
                <p>Sure, it&#39;ll help with some mundane tasks, but it&#39;ll just compliment what we already do as humans rather than take control. </p>
                <p>It&#39;s like when the internet came out. A lot of people thought that people would get lazy and that it would make everything worse. But really, it just enhanced human life and created a better quality of life.</p>
                <p>I think the same thing will happen with AI. It will enhance the quality of life by automating mundane, formulaic, repetitive tasks.</p>
                <p>I also believe that as more AI content gets posted on the internet, AI will train on itself and it will plateau in performance. It will have less completely novel data to train on, and also the internet is just really similar to what it was in the past generally and so we already have so much of this data that it would take novel sources of new human input to get more valuable data to train AI models on.</p>
                <p>I also believe that in order to get more novel data to train on, AI will need to figure out more ways to get it from the real world. That&#39;s where I believe hardware will come into play, such as wearables like Meta&#39;s Ray-Ban glasses, Halo Nova, or Omi. Companies are quietly getting in on it, and OpenAI is expectedly releasing wearable devices in 2026.</p>
                <p>I believe the future is headed towards wearables akin to human-tech augmentation.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, I believe that robotics will continue to be researched and improved. Though I think there&#39;s still some time until it&#39;s implemented on a greater scale in society. Maybe five years give or take, we&#39;ll see some of that come to life.</p>
                <p>I am very bullish on the future. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much reason to be afraid. </p>
                <p>The nature of civilization and humanity is to continue improving, and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always been doing and are doing here.</p>

                <p>Today I want to talk about words. </p>
                <p>I see a lot of fancy terms in tech that as an outsider to tech, you might not understand right away.</p>
                <p>&quot;Multi-agent orchestration&quot; is one of them. It essentially means working with multiple AI language models that are able to do tool calling. </p>
                <p>So for example, you have several ChatGPTs on a SWE team. I&#39;ll call them Alex, Sara, Mike, Lora, John. Alex is the group leader (orchestrator), Sara is the systems architect, Mike is the developer, Lora is the designer, and John is the tester. So Alex as the orchestrator will interpret the task and call the other people to do their jobs. Lets say you prompted Alex with: &quot;I want you to build a website&quot; or &quot;please help me iterate on this design idea...&quot;. Alex will call the relevant people to do their jobs. </p>
                <p>A lot of people might hear &quot;multi-agent orchestration&quot; and their eyes widen. But it is just a fancy way of saying &quot;I use LangChain.&quot; LangChain is a popular library for orchestrating multiple AI language models.</p>
                <p>In the social circles people are in, they use terms that they are used to hearing with each other. For example, some of my friends use &quot;bet&quot;, &quot;cooked&quot;, &quot;glaze&quot;, etc. Being in SF for a couple of weeks, I keep hearing people saying &quot;robust&quot;. This is just a fancy, technical way of saying &quot;good&quot;. </p>
                <p>A lot of these terms are the same, but used in different scenarios or by different types of people. It&#39;s almost like a language barrier between different social classes.</p>

                <p>I wanted to share some thoughts on the recent layoffs at tech companies.</p>
                <p>I feel for the people who lost their jobs. I think in America, our work is strongly tied to our identity.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I think it can be selfish to target companies for laying off employees. </p>
                <p>The game of companies in the American economy is to optimize for profit. To make profit, these companies need to bring value to the world. </p>
                <p>In order to bring value to the world, they need employees that can bring value to the company.</p>
                <p>If people aren&#39;t bringing in value to the company, three things may happen. </p>
                <ol>
                <li><p>their position will be modified to something that is more valuable to the company, or </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>they will remain in their position, but be negatively impacting the company.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>If the company is unable to modify the employee&#39;s position to be more valuable to the company, the employee will be laid off.</p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p>This is the natural course of the American economy.</p>
                <p>75 yrs ago, jobs looked different than they do today. In another 75 yrs, they will look different again. </p>
                <p>I think it&#39;s important to remember that America is innovative and competitive. </p>
                <p>Things are constantly changing and we need to adapt and be proactive in our careers.</p>
                <p>We need to find a path in our careers that we truly love.</p>
